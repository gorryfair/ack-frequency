# Introduction

This document describes a QUIC extension for an endpoint to control its peer's
delaying of acknowledgements.

## Terms and Definitions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

In the rest of this document, "sender" refers to a QUIC data sender (and
acknowledgement receiver). Similarly, "receiver" refers to a QUIC data receiver
(and acknowledgement sender).

An "acknowledgement packet" refers to a QUIC packet that contains only an ACK
frame.

This document uses terms, definitions, and notational conventions described in
{{Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

# Motivation

A receiver acknowledges received packets, but it can delay sending these
acknowledgements. The delaying of acknowledgements can impact connection
throughput, loss detection and congestion controller performance at a data
sender, and CPU utilization at both a data sender and a data receiver.

Reducing the frequency of acknowledgement packets can improve connection and
endpoint performance in the following ways:

- Sending UDP packets can be noticeably CPU intensive on some
  platforms. Reducing the number of packets that only contain acknowledgements
  can therefore reduce the amount of CPU consumed at a data receiver. Experience
  shows that this cost reduction can be significant for high bandwidth
  connections.

- Similarly, receiving and processing UDP packets can also be CPU intensive, and
  reducing acknowledgement frequency reduces this cost at a data sender.

- For severely asymmetric link technologies, such as DOCSIS, LTE, and satellite
  links, connection throughput in the forward path can become constrained
  when the reverse path is filled by acknowledgment packets. When traversing
  such links, reducing the number of acknowledgments can achieve higher
  connection throughput.

- The rate of acknowledgment packets can impact link efficiency, including
  transmission opportunities or battery life.


As discussed in {{implementation}} however, there can be undesirable consequences
to congestion control and loss recovery if a receiver uniltaerally reduces the
acknowledgment frequency. A sender's constraints on the acknowledgement
frequency need to be taken into account to maximize congestion controller and
loss recovery performance.

{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} currently specifies a simple delayed acknowledgement
mechanism that a receiver can use: send an acknowledgement for every other
packet, and for every packet that is received out of order (Section
13.2.1 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). This
simple mechanism does not allow a sender to signal its constraints. This
extension provides a mechanism to solve this problem.

# Negotiating Extension Use

Endpoints advertise their support of the extension described in this document by
sending the following transport parameter ({{Section 7.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}):

min_ack_delay (0xff03de1a):

: A variable-length integer representing the minimum amount of time in
  microseconds by which the endpoint can delay an acknowledgement. This limit
  could be based on the receiver's clock or timer granularity.

An endpoint's min_ack_delay MUST NOT be greater than its max_ack_delay.
Endpoints that support this extension MUST treat receipt of a min_ack_delay that
is greater than the received max_ack_delay as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR. Note that while the endpoint's max_ack_delay
transport parameter is in milliseconds ({{Section 18.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}),
min_ack_delay is specified in microseconds.

The min_ack_delay transport parameter is a unilateral indication of support for
receiving ACK_FREQUENCY frames.  If an endpoint sends the transport parameter,
the peer is allowed to send ACK_FREQUENCY frames independent of whether it also
sends the min_ack_delay transport parameter or not.

Receiving a min_ack_delay transport parameter indicates that the peer might send
ACK_FREQUENCY frames in the future. Until an ACK_FREQUENCY frame is received,
receiving this transport parameter does not cause the endpoint to
change its acknowledgement behavior.

Endpoints MUST NOT remember the value of the min_ack_delay transport parameter
they received. Consequently, ACK_FREQUENCY frames cannot be sent in 0-RTT
packets, as per {{Section 7.4.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

This Transport Parameter is encoded as per {{Section 18 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

# ACK_FREQUENCY Frame

Delaying acknowledgements as much as possible reduces both work done by the
endpoints and network load. An endpoint's loss detection and congestion control
mechanisms however need to be tolerant of this delay at the peer. An endpoint
signals the frequency it wants to receive ACK frames to its peer using an
ACK_FREQUENCY frame, shown below:

~~~
ACK_FREQUENCY Frame {
  Type (i) = 0xaf,
  Sequence Number (i),
  Ack-Eliciting Threshold (i),
  Request Max Ack Delay (i),
  Reserved (7),
  Ignore Order (1)
}
~~~

Following the common frame format described in {{Section 12.4 of
QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, ACK_FREQUENCY frames have a type of 0xaf, and contain the
following fields:

Sequence Number:

: A variable-length integer representing the sequence number assigned to the
  ACK_FREQUENCY frame by the sender to allow receivers to ignore obsolete
  frames, see {{multiple-frames}}.

Ack-Eliciting Threshold:

: A variable-length integer representing the maximum number of ack-eliciting
  packets the recipient of this frame can receive without sending an
  acknowledgment. In other words, an acknowledgement is sent when more than this
  number of ack-eliciting packets have been received. Since this is a maximum
  value, a receiver can send an acknowledgement earlier. A value of 0 results in
  a receiver immediately acknowledging every ack-eliciting packet.

Request Max Ack Delay:

: A variable-length integer representing the value to which the endpoint
  requests the peer update its `max_ack_delay`
  ({{Section 18.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). The value of this field is in
  microseconds, unlike the 'max_ack_delay' transport parameter, which is in
  milliseconds. Sending a value smaller than the `min_ack_delay` advertised
  by the peer is invalid. Receipt of an invalid value MUST be treated as a
  connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

Reserved:

: This field has no meaning in this version of ACK_FREQUENCY.  The value of this
  field MUST be 0x00. Receipt of any other value MUST be treated as a
  connection error of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.

Ignore Order:

: A 1-bit field representing a boolean truth value. This field is
  set to `true` by an endpoint that does not wish to receive an immediate
  acknowledgement when the peer receives a packet out of order
  ({{out-of-order}}). 0 represents 'false' and 1 represents 'true'.

ACK_FREQUENCY frames are ack-eliciting. However, their loss does not require
retransmission if an ACK_FREQUENCY frame with a larger Sequence Number value
has been sent.

An endpoint MAY send ACK_FREQUENCY frames multiple times during a connection and
with different values.

An endpoint will have committed a `max_ack_delay` value to the peer, which
specifies the maximum amount of time by which the endpoint will delay sending
acknowledgments. When the endpoint receives an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, it MUST
update this maximum time to the value proposed by the peer in the Request Max
Ack Delay field.


# Multiple ACK_FREQUENCY Frames {#multiple-frames}

An endpoint can send multiple ACK_FREQUENCY frames, and each one of them can
have different values in all fields. An endpoint MUST use a sequence number of 0
for the first ACK_FREQUENCY frame it constructs and sends, and a strictly
increasing value thereafter.

An endpoint MUST allow reordered ACK_FREQUENCY frames to be received and
processed, see {{Section 13.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

On the first received ACK_FREQUENCY frame in a connection, an endpoint MUST
immediately record all values from the frame. The sequence number of the frame
is recorded as the largest seen sequence number. The new Ack-Eliciting Threshold
and Request Max Ack Delay values MUST be immediately used for delaying
acknowledgements; see {{sending}}.

On a subsequently received ACK_FREQUENCY frame, the endpoint MUST check if this
frame is more recent than any previous ones, as follows:

- If the frame's sequence number is not greater than the largest one seen so
  far, the endpoint MUST ignore this frame.

- If the frame's sequence number is greater than the largest one seen so far,
  the endpoint MUST immediately replace old recorded state with values received
  in this frame. The endpoint MUST start using the new values immediately for
  delaying acknowledgements; see {{sending}}. The endpoint MUST also replace the
  recorded sequence number.


# IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame

A sender can use an ACK_FREQUENCY frame to reduce the number of acknowledgements
sent by a receiver, but doing so increases the chances that time-sensitive
feedback is delayed as well. For example, as described in {{loss}}, delaying
acknowledgements can increase the time it takes for a sender to detect packet
loss. The IMMEDIATE_ACK frame helps mitigate this problem.

An IMMEDIATE_ACK frame can be useful in other situations as well. For example,
it can be used with a PING frame (Section 19.2 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) if a
sender wants an immediate RTT measurement or if a sender wants to establish
receiver liveness as quickly as possible.

An endpoint SHOULD send a packet containing an ACK frame immediately upon
receiving an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame. An endpoint MAY delay sending an ACK frame
despite receiving an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame. For example, an endpoint might do this
if a large number of received packets contain an IMMEDIATE_ACK or if the
endpoint is under heavy load.

~~~
IMMEDIATE_ACK Frame {
  Type (i) = 0xac,
}
~~~


# Sending Acknowledgments {#sending}

Prior to receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, endpoints send acknowledgements as
specified in {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

On receiving an ACK_FREQUENCY frame and updating its recorded `max_ack_delay`
and `Ack-Eliciting Threshold` values ({{multiple-frames}}), the endpoint MUST send an
acknowledgement when one of the following conditions are met:

- Since the last acknowledgement was sent, the number of received ack-eliciting
  packets is greater than or equal to the recorded `Ack-Eliciting Threshold`.

- Since the last acknowledgement was sent, `max_ack_delay` amount of time has
  passed.

{{out-of-order}}, {{congestion}}, and {{batch}} describe exceptions to this
strategy.

An endpoint is expected to bundle acknowledgements when possible. Every time an
acknowledgement is sent, bundled or otherwise, all counters and timers related
to delaying of acknowledgments are reset.

The receiver of an ACK_FREQUENCY frame can continue to process multiple available
packets before determining whether to send an ACK frame in response, as stated in
{{Section 13.2.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

## Response to Out-of-Order Packets {#out-of-order}

As specified in {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, endpoints are expected to
send an acknowledgement immediately on receiving a reordered ack-eliciting
packet. This extension modifies this behavior.

If the endpoint has not yet received an ACK_FREQUENCY frame, or if the most
recent frame received from the peer has an `Ignore Order` value of `false`
(0x00), the endpoint MUST immediately acknowledge any subsequent packets that
are received out of order.

If the most recent ACK_FREQUENCY frame received from the peer has an `Ignore
Order` value of `true` (0x01), the endpoint does not make this exception. That
is, the endpoint MUST NOT send an immediate acknowledgement in response to
packets received out of order, and instead continues to use the peer's
`Ack-Eliciting Threshold` and `max_ack_delay` thresholds for sending
acknowledgements.

## Expediting Congestion Signals {#congestion}

An endpoint SHOULD send an immediate acknowledgement when a packet marked
with the ECN Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint in the IP header is
received and the previously received packet was not marked CE.

Doing this maintains the peer's response time to congestion events, while also
reducing the ACK rate compared to {{Section 13.2.1 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}} during
extreme congestion or when peers are using DCTCP {{?RFC8257}} or other
congestion controllers that mark more frequently than classic ECN {{?RFC3168}}.


## Batch Processing of Packets {#batch}

For performance reasons, an endpoint can receive incoming packets from the
underlying platform in a batch of multiple packets. This batch can contain
enough packets to cause multiple acknowledgements to be sent.

To avoid sending multiple acknowledgements in rapid succession, an endpoint MAY
process all packets in a batch before determining whether a threshold has been
met and an acknowledgement is to be sent in response.


# Computation of Probe Timeout Period

On sending an update to the peer's `max_ack_delay`, an endpoint can use this new
value in later computations of its Probe Timeout (PTO) period; see {{Section 5.2.1
of QUIC-RECOVERY}}. The endpoint MUST however wait until the ACK_FREQUENCY
frame that carries this new value is acknowledged by the peer.

Until the frame is acknowledged, the endpoint MUST use the greater of the
current `max_ack_delay` and the value that is in flight when computing the PTO
period. Doing so avoids spurious PTOs that can be caused by an update that
increases the peer's `max_ack_delay`.

While it is expected that endpoints will have only one ACK_FREQUENCY frame in
flight at any given time, this extension does not prohibit having more than one
in flight. When using `max_ack_delay` for PTO computations, endpoints MUST use
the maximum of the current value and all those in flight.

When the number of in-flight ack-eliciting packets is larger than the
ACK-Eliciting Threshold, an endpoint can expect that the peer will not need to
wait for its `max_ack_delay` period before sending an acknowledgement. In such
cases, the endpoint MAY therefore exclude the peer's 'max_ack_delay' from its PTO
calculation.  When Ignore Order is enabled and loss causes the peer to not
receive enough packets to trigger an immediate acknowledgement, the receiver
will wait 'max_ack_delay', increasing the chances of a premature PTO.
Therefore, if Ignore Order is enabled, the PTO MUST be larger than the peer's
'max_ack_delay'.


# Determining Acknowledgement Frequency {#implementation}

This section provides some guidance on a sender's choice of acknowledgment
frequency and discusses some additional considerations. Implementers can select
an appropriate strategy to meet the needs of their applications and congestion
controllers.

## Congestion Control

A sender needs to be responsive to notifications of congestion, such as
a packet loss or an ECN CE marking. Also, window-based congestion controllers
that strictly adhere to packet conservation, such as the one defined in
{{QUIC-RECOVERY}}, rely on receipt of acknowledgments to send additional data into
the network, and will suffer degraded performance if acknowledgments are delayed
excessively.

To enable a sender to respond to potential network congestion, a sender SHOULD
cause a receiver to send an acknowledgement at least once per RTT if there are
unacknowledged ack-eliciting packets in flight. A sender can accomplish this by
sending an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame once per round-trip time (RTT), or it can set the
Ack-Eliciting Threshold and Request Max Ack Delay values to be no more than a
congestion window and an estimated RTT, respectively.

## Burst Mitigation

Receiving an acknowledgement can allow a sender to release new packets into the
network. If a sender is designed to rely on the timing of peer acknowledgments
("ACK clock"), delaying acknowledgments can cause undesirable bursts of data
into the network. A sender MUST limit such bursts. In keeping with Section 7.7
of {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}, a sender can either employ pacing or cause a receiver to
send an acknowledgement for at least each initial congestion window of received
data.

## Loss Detection and Timers {#loss}

Acknowledgements are fundamental to reliability in QUIC. Consequently,
delaying or reducing the frequency of acknowledgments can cause loss detection
at the sender to be delayed.

A QUIC sender detects loss using packet thresholds on receiving an
acknowledgement (Section 6.1.1 of {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}); delaying the
acknowledgement therefore delays this method of detecting losses.

Reducing acknowledgement frequency reduces the number of RTT samples that a
sender receives (Section 5 of {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}), making a sender's RTT estimate
less responsive to changes in the path's RTT. As a result, any mechanisms that
rely on an accurate RTT estimate, such as time-threshold loss detection (Section
6.1.2 of {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}) or Probe Timeout (Section 6.2 of {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}),
will be less responsive to changes in the path's RTT, resulting in either
delayed or unnecessary packet transmissions.

To limit these consequences of reduced acknowledgement frequency, a sender
SHOULD cause a receiver to send an acknowledgement at least once per RTT if
there are unacknowledged ack-eliciting packets in flight. A sender can
accomplish this by sending an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame once per round-trip time
(RTT), or it can set the Ack-Eliciting Threshold and Request Max Ack Delay
values to be no more than a congestion window and an estimated RTT,
respectively.

A sender might use timers to detect loss of PMTU probe packets ({{Section 14 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}). 
A sender SHOULD
bundle an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with any PTMU probes to avoid triggering such
timers.

## Connection Migration {#migration}

To avoid additional delays to connection migration confirmation when using this
extension, a client can bundle an IMMEDIATE_ACK frame with the first non-probing
frame ({{Section 9.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) it sends or it can send only an
IMMEDIATE_ACK frame, which is a non-probing frame.

An endpoint's congestion controller and RTT estimator are reset upon
confirmation of migration ({{Section 9.4 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}), which can impact
the number of acknowledgements received after migration. An endpoint that has
sent an ACK_FREQUENCY frame earlier in the connection SHOULD update and send a
new ACK_FREQUENCY frame immediately upon confirmation of connection migration.
